## Let's encrypt DNS provisioning

This is a MirageOS unikernel which provisions TLS certificates using
[let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). It looks for certificate signing
requests, stored as TLSA records in DNS zones, and uses the let's encrypt
ACME DNS challenge to retrieve certificates. The certificate chain is stored
in DNS as TLSA record as well. This unikernel also ensures that certificates
are valid for at least two weeks.

This can be used with [dns-primary-git](https://github.com/roburio/dns-primary-git).
